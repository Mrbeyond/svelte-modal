# svelte-modal
Created svelte modal component using scss
```
This is a single page modal component for svelte environment but can easily be modified into any js framework. Sass and a few touch of tailwind is used. The tailwind css apllied are not part of the core logic but basically to suit the current project that's been built for before thinking of extraction for future use.
